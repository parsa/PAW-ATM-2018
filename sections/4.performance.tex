\section{Quantifying AGAS Performance}
\label{performance}

The main objective of any HPC memory addressing system, including AGAS, is to
handle massive amount of data that is used by applications that use it.
In HPX this task is performed by AGAS. To study AGAS, we use OctoTiger\cite{kadam2017numerical,octotiger_repo} as our application and run it on the cluster
provided by the Center of Computation and Technology at Louisiana State
University. In the rest of this section we discuss the applications
we use to benchmark AGAS and the performance metrics that we use judge AGAS
based on.

\subsection{OctoTiger}
%\todo[inline, color=red!50]{What is it? Why did we choose it? What are the implications of this choice?}%
LSU OctoTiger is a state of the art multi-physics AMR HPX application that
simulates the merger of double white dwarf binaries. Its computations include
hydrodynamics, gravitational, and radiation transportation solvers. It fully
utilizes the capabilities of AGAS in HPX since it dynamically changes the
computational resolution based on the actual needs of the simulation and thus, 
it is an inherently balance impaired application.

We use OctoTiger to study the behavior of AGAS when used by applications
running on large machines. We ran our experiments on SuperMIC at Louisiana
State University, a hybrid cluster composed of Xeon, Xeon Phi Knights Corner, 
and NVIDIA Tesla processors. Due to the complexity of the computations
performed by OctoTiger, adjusting the size of the problem with reasonable
accuracy to demonstrate weak scaling is not practical and therefore we
presenting the impacts of strong scaling on AGAS behavior.

\subsection{System and Environment Setup}
%\todo[inline, color=red!50]{Where are the experiments run? Why? What are the implications of this choice?}%
We run our experiments on SuperMIC, a hybrid Xeon/Xeon Phi cluster that
comprises 360 compute nodes located at Louisiana State University. More
details about the configuration of SuperMIC is included in Table
\ref{tab:machines}. We run OctoTiger on SuperMIC from
two nodes to 200 nodes only using the Xeon processors on each machine using
HPX 0.99\cite{hartmut_kaiser_2015_33656}.

\subsection{Performance Metrics}
Every globally accessible object in HPX has a global id that AGAS manages and
resolves to local virtual addresses at runtime. However, address resolution at runtime is
an overhead that consumes computational resources that application developers expect to be used by the
applications rather than the runtime system. To quantify and study the overhead of AGAS, we look at the following
fundamental operations, the number of calls, and the amount of time that is
spent performing these operations.

\subsubsection{Bind, Unbind, Object Lookup}
Bind and Unbind operations occur when a global object is created and deleted, 
respectively. An object lookup operation takes place each time AGAS attempts 
to resolve a global Id.

\subsubsection{Locality Lookup}
Each AGAS instance only knows about itself and locality 0. When an AGAS
instance needs to communicate with another locality and does not have
information about the appropriate communication endpoint to do so it needs to
query that information from locality 0.

\subsubsection{Parcel Routing}
HPX implements active messages in the form of parcels. A parcel is packaged
information that triggers an operation upon reception by an AGAS instance. For
example, when an HPX task needs to operate on information that resides on
another locality, AGAS serializes the task along with its arguments and state
information and forwards it to the locality on which data resides.

\subsubsection{Cache}
Whenever AGAS decides that an address is likely to be queried again, it stores
that information in the local AGAS cache of that locality. To serve its purpose of actually improving
performance the AGAS cache is designed to hold a limited number of entries that is
defined by user configuration.

\subsubsection{Garbage Collection}
\label{sec:garbage_collection}
HPX provides managed objects whose lifetime is controlled by the garbage
collection mechanism instead of the programmer having to free the memory
consumed by each object. HPX uses reference counting to track references local
to each AGAS instance and a credit scheme to manage global references. Once an
object no longer has any local references and/or all its global reference
credits are returned it is deemed garbage and is collected when the garbage
collection operation is triggered by reaching a certain threshold or by the
application developer. Registration and removal of global references is done by
calling increment\_credit and decrement\_credit functions, respectively.
