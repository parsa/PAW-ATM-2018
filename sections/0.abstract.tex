In this research, we describe the functionality of AGAS, a subsystem of the HPX
runtime system that is designed to handle data, independent of the hardware and
architecture configuration. AGAS enables runtime global data access and data
migration, but incurs a an overhead cost at runtime. We present
a method to assess the performance of AGAS and the amount of impact
it has on execution of the OctoTiger application. With our assessment method we identify
three problematic spots in the HPX version used in our experiments.


%data during
%runtime means a portion of the application execution time is spent executing
%AGAS code. To assess AGAS's performance we introduce and present a method using
%data that can be gathered using HPX's Performance Counter framework. We apply
%this method on a strong scaling experiment running an AMR application called
%OctoTiger and present our measurements.
