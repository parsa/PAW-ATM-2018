In this research, we describe the functionality of AGAS, a subsystem of the HPX
runtime system that is designed to handle data, independent of the hardware and
architecture configuration. AGAS performs enables global data accesses and data
migration but incurs a an overhead cost at runtime. We present
a method to assess the performance of AGAS and the amount of burden
it imposes on application execution. With our assessment method we identified
three problematic spots in the HPX version used in our experiments that need to
be fixed.


%data during
%runtime means a portion of the application execution time is spent executing
%AGAS code. To assess AGAS's performance we introduce and present a method using
%data that can be gathered using HPX's Performance Counter framework. We apply
%this method on a strong scaling experiment running an AMR application called
%OctoTiger and present our measurements.
