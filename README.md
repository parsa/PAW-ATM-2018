## What is this?

A workshop paper.

## What does it say?

Introduces AGAS and demonstrates a method to evaluate its performance.

## Where is it supposed to be published and why?

* SC18 - PAW-ATM: Parallel Applications Workshop - Alternatives to MPI
    * <https://sc18.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=wksp108&sess=sess144>
    * <http://sourceryinstitute.github.io/PAW/>
* Reason: This paper presents performance. Suggestions are welcome.

## What is/are the experiments, what data is collected, what information is presented?

* Experiments: OctoTiger runs on SuperMIC, from 2 nodes upward what max possible nodes. Max nodes we can get is 360.
    * Update: 200 nodes
* Data: AGAS performance counter data.
* Information presented: Performance bottlenecks in AGAS.

## What is the *current* status of this paper?

Submitted. Rejected.
